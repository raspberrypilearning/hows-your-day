### Mood animator 

Watch the start up instructions, which tell you to use a tilt or shake gesture to match the mood shown on the LEDs:

- Tilt the micro:bit **right** to select a ‘Good’ mood, shown by a smiley face 🙂
- Tilt the micro:bit **left** to select an ‘OK’ mood, shown by a neutral face 😐
- **Shake** the micro:bit to select a ‘Not good’ mood, shown by a frowning face 🙁

When you have chosen your mood with your tilt or shake gesture, you will see an up arrow **^** shown on the LEDs. 

This means you should press the touch logo to set your mood.

This will display an animation response to match your mood:

- A celebration dance to celebrate a 'Good' mood
- An encouragement to smile in response to an 'OK' mood
- A breathing animation to acknowledge a 'Not good' mood

### Graph that mood

This is a **mood indicator** that helps people keep track of their mood, and let others know how they're feeling.

The program has:
+ A start-up screen
+ Buttons to set the level of your mood
+ A graph, an emoji, and/or sounds to show how you are feeling

1. Watch the start-up animation and instructions
2. Use Button A each time you feel happy and Button B each time you feel sad
3. Your mood will be displayed on a graph, and using an emoji
