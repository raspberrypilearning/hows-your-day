This is an upgraded version of one of the example programs.

1. There are now more moods to choose from
2. When the event button is pressed to set the mood, the mood is also logged
3. The data from sensor inputs such as sound, light and temperatue levels are logged (sound is not available for V2 users). This will allow the user check what around them might be affecting their mood.
