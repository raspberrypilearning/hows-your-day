## Share and play

If you are in a club, why not share your project with friends?

You could also show your family how your project works.

You can share your project through MakeCode. You can send a link to people you know!

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
  Being active can boost your <span style="color: #0faeb0">**confidence**</span> and make you feel proud. Every time you learn a new move or finish a game, you prove to yourself what you're capable of. You could say the same about completing a computing project!
