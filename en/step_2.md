## Start-up screen

You may want your friends and family to share and use your mood checker. 

This means you need to create a start-up screen to show some instructions for how to use it.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
  <span style="color: #0faeb0">**User experience**</span> design is an important part of creating a product. It means thinking about ways to make your programs easy to understand and use.
</p>

### Choose your theme

--- task ---

Think about when you've come home from school or from an outing and your family or friends have asked how your day went. What responses did you give?

You might have said:
+ I had a good day
+ I had an okay day
+ I didn't have a good day

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
  <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Moods**</span> are the way you feel on different days or at different times of the day. Sometimes you might feel really happy, like when you're playing with your favourite toys or spending time with friends. Other times, you might feel a little bit sad or grumpy. Moods can change throughout the day, and it's okay to have different moods.
</p>

Based on the mood your user chooses, you can create responses that use:

+ Text to show the user a message 
+ Icons and animations to cheer them up
+ Melodies and sounds for calmness or excitement

### Create your project

--- task ---

Open the MakeCode editor at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org){:target="_blank"}.

--- collapse ---

---
title: Offline version of the editor
---

There is also a [downloadable version of the MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/offline-app){:target="_blank"}.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

Once the editor is open, create a new project and give your project a name. 

--- task ---

Click on the **New Project** button.

<img src="images/new-project-button.png" alt="The New Project button inside MakeCode." width="250"/>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Tip:** Give your project a helpful name that relates to the program youâ€™re creating. This will make it easier to find if you create other projects on MakeCode.

--- /task ---


### Make your start-up screen

Create a start-up screen that shows your user what your device is for and how to use it.

You will make this in the `on start`{:class='microbitbasic'} block of your new project. 

--- task ---

Add some `Basic`{:class='microbitbasic'} blocks to your `on start`{:class='microbitbasic'} block. The blocks you choose will depend on what you want your user to see when the program starts.

You could show an **icon**, make an **animation**, or display **text**.

For instance, it could show a heart.

```microbit
basic.showIcon(IconNames.Heart)
```

[[[microbit-icons]]]

[[[microbit-animation]]]

[[[microbit-text]]]

If your start-up screen is complicated, you might want to organise the code into a **function**.

[[[microbit-function]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your screen, show it to a friend and see if they know what the program does. 

--- /task ---

### Select a mood


Your program should the ask user about their day and let them choose from set options.

--- task ---

Add instructions to the `on start`{:class='microbitbasic'} block by using `show string`{:class='microbitbasic'}.

The instructions should tell the user how to select each mood.

This will help the user know what gestures to use to input their mood.

[[[microbit-text]]]

Remember: Text on a micro:bit takes a long time to scroll, so keep your text short.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add icons to represent each mood.

[[[microbit-icons]]]

--- /task ---

### Choose three moods

--- task ---

You now need to add gestures for each mood. 
You need to add one gesture each for:
+ Good day
+ Okay day
+ Bad day

[[[microbit-gesture-trigger]]]

--- /task ---

### Create a variable

--- task ---

Create a variable called `mood`. 

[[[microbit-create-variables]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Add the variable to your `gesture`{:class='microbitinput'} block.

Here is an example of the code blocks you could use:

```microbit
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, function () {
    mood = 0
})
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---

You will also need to use a number to represent each mood. 

For example, `Good day` could be `1`, `Okay day` could be `2`, and `Bad day` could be `3`.

Change the `0` to `1` in your `set mood`{:class='microbitvariables'} variable to match the correct mood. 

```microbit
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, function () {
    mood = 1
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

You could show an **icon** or an **animation** to represent each mood. You could also draw something using `show leds`{:class='microbitbasic'}.

[[[microbit-icons]]]

[[[microbit-animation]]]

Your event block should now look something like this (the exact blocks may be different):

```microbit
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, function () {
    mood = 1
    basic.showLeds(`
        # # . # #
        . . . . .
        . . # . #
        . # # # .
        . # # # .
        `)
})
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Repeat these steps twice so you have blocks for each gesture.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

In your `gesture`{:class='microbitinput'} block, tell the user to use an `event` to set their mood. In our example, we've told them to press `Button A`.

[[[microbit-text]]]

For a better user experience, add a `pause`{:class='microbitbasic'} and a `clear screen`{:class='microbitbasic'} block between the mood icon and the instruction block.

```microbit
input.onGesture(Gesture.Shake, function () {
    mood = 1
    basic.showLeds(`
        # # . # #
        . . . . .
        . . # . #
        . # # # .
        . # # # .
        `)
    basic.pause(100)
    basic.clearScreen()
    basic.showString("Press A")
})
```
--- /task ---

### Test your program

--- task ---

When the simulator restarts, check that you're happy with the instructions, icons, and animation for your start-up screen.

Check that when you use a gesture such as a `on tilt right`{:class='microbitinput'} block, the correct mood icon or animation is shown.
